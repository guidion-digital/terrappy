# Contributing / Development

Since we are in the early days of this project, outside contributors will find it difficult contribute. Having said that, any and all help is welcome ðŸ™‚

## Releasing

The application modules use [mathieudutour/github-tag-action](https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action?tab=readme-ov-file) to create releases, following Angular commit message conventions:

- `FIX(foobar)` â€”Â patch
- `FEAT(foobar)` â€” minor
- `PERF(foobar)` â€” major

Helper modules are currently released manually, but they will soon follow the above procedure.
